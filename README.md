# Python: Pangram

Determine if a sentence is a pangram.

Determine if a sentence is a pangram. A pangram (Greek: παν γράμμα, pan gramma,
"every letter") is a sentence using every letter of the alphabet at least once.
The best known English pangram is "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."

The alphabet used is ASCII, and case insensitive, from 'a' to 'z'
inclusively.

To run a test file, pass it as an argument to the `python` command:

    python hello_world_test.py

If you want to stop the tests after the first failure, then you can use the pytest library.

Install pytest with pip:

    pip install pytest

Run the tests with the `py.test` command using the `-x` flag to exit after the first failure.

    py.test -x hello_world_test.py
